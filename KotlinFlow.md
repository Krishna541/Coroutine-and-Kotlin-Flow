# Kotlin Flow API
- Flow API in Kotlin is a better way to handle the stream of data asynchronously that executes sequentially.
- Add the following in the app's build.gradle,
```
implementation "org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-core:1.3.3"
implementation "org.jetbrains.kotlinx:kotlinx-coroutines-android:1.3.3"
```
- and in the project's build.gradle add,
```
classpath "org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin:1.3.61"
```
